# Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Point Cloud Data

Open-source application of SAM on 3D point cloud inputs from ScanNet++ dataset using spherical projection.

Post-processing of segmented 3D point cloud outputs with k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.

Group project for the 'Machine Learning for 3D Geometry' course at TUM.
